        <title>Hello! Let&#39;s start with CLion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Vladyslav Batyrenko, I’m a student living in Kyiv, Ukraine.
This is my first GSoC blog post about my participating in Ark project.
In this post I would like to tell you how I managed to set up my environment
for coding with CLion, utilizing it not only as an editor but also as a
debugging tool. You may think that’s a trivial task almost every IDE can handle - 
and this is true, but until your project requires a non-trivial deployment
process before it is able to start. So if you want to know how to build,
deploy and run/debug your executable with pressing only &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(SHIFT+F10)&lt;/code&gt; buttons,
you may find this post useful.&lt;/p&gt;
